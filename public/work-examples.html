    <!-- CASE STUDY 1 -->
    <section class="case-study" id="case-insurance-crm">
    <div class="case-study-content">
        <h2>Insurance CRM Transformation & Sales Enablement</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>The Client:</strong> A group of UK insurance brokers and employee benefits
            providers operating in highly regulated, high-volume sales environments. Clients
            included Consilium Employee Benefits, Chase Templeton, Towergate Insurance, Square Mile
            Broking, and Clear Insurance, operating across multiple ownership changes and business
            structures.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Challenge:</strong> The organisations relied on a fragmented mix of legacy
            CRM platforms, spreadsheets, and manual processes. This resulted in duplicated data,
            limited reporting, poor sales visibility, and operational risk during mergers and
            acquisitions. The requirement was to design and implement a scalable CRM system capable
            of supporting telemarketing, renewals, and compliant client communication while
            preserving data integrity through business transitions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Solution &amp; Result:</strong> I led the specification, migration, and
            deployment of a CallPro-based CRM solution, tailored specifically for insurance sales
            and telemarketing workflows. This included structured data hierarchies, automated email
            and call campaigns driven by renewal and prospect status, and real-time reporting for
            management. The solution delivered seamless data continuity across multiple acquisitions,
            improved lead conversion and retention, and provided leadership teams with clear,
            actionable insight into pipeline value and sales performance.

    <!-- CASE STUDY 3 -->
   <section class="case-study" id="case-video-ingest">
    <div class="case-study-content">
        <h2>Global Video Ingest, Proxy & Archive System</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>The Client:</strong> A global video marketing agency within the manufacturing
            sector, producing and managing large volumes of high-resolution video content across
            multiple editors and geographic locations.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Video files were fragmented across individual editing
            workstations, posted physical media, and dozens of consumer-grade external hard drives.
            There was no central archive, no reliable backup strategy, and no effective way to search
            or retrieve historical content. Data loss was common, ingest was slow, and accessing
            specific footage could take weeks—or be impossible entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Research &amp; Cost Analysis:</strong> An extensive review was conducted across
            commercial SaaS media management platforms, bespoke vendor solutions, and enterprise
            storage providers. Many off-the-shelf systems carried annual costs in the tens of
            thousands of pounds while still lacking core requirements such as flexible ingest,
            proxy workflows, or true ownership of the data. Bespoke vendor proposals were
            significantly higher again, often requiring long-term contracts and ongoing licence
            fees.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Solution:</strong> Rather than adopting an expensive and inflexible platform,
            I designed and deployed a self-hosted system built around two high-capacity QNAP storage
            units, each providing approximately 100&nbsp;TB of storage. One system was deployed
            on-site, with a second installed at a remote location for full failover. Using QNAP HBS3,
            the primary system synchronises continuously with Dropbox, enabling global ingest while
            maintaining high-speed local access via a 10&nbsp;Gb internal network and a 1&nbsp;Gb
            leased line.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Workflow:</strong> Media can be ingested from anywhere worldwide or directly
            within the office. An automated batch process monitors new files hourly and generates
            proxy media at approximately 5&nbsp;% of the original file size. Remote editors can begin
            work immediately on low-bandwidth connections while full-resolution assets continue
            downloading in the background. Nightly replication to the secondary QNAP provides
            full-system redundancy. Long-term archive is handled via Amazon S3 Glacier, selected
            following cost modelling that showed retrieval costs of only fractions of a penny per
            file.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Result &amp; Cost Impact:</strong> The complete system was delivered for
            approximately £7,000 in capital expenditure, with no ongoing SaaS licensing costs.
            Ongoing operational costs are limited to around £100 per month for cold archive storage
            in S3 Glacier and £216 per year for Dropbox. Compared to the nearest commercially viable
            off-the-shelf solution, this represented an estimated 70–80&nbsp;% reduction in annual
            cost. When compared to the higher-end bespoke and enterprise solutions evaluated, the
            system was over 90&nbsp;% cheaper while delivering greater flexibility, faster ingest,
            and full ownership of the data.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond cost savings, the impact on operations was transformative. Editing throughput
            increased immediately, data loss was eliminated, and any project can now be accessed by
            any editor worldwide at any time. The system removed reliance on physical media, local
            storage, and manual file transfers, fundamentally changing how the business operates.

        <h2>Eurofood Brands — Corporate Promo / Sales Outreach Video</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>The Client:</strong> Eurofood Brands (EFB) is a UK-based importer and distributor established in 1991,
            specialising in bringing global food and beverage brands to the UK &amp; Ireland. Their portfolio includes
            brands such as Barilla, illy, Hershey&#39;s, and Peppadew, with a focus on brand building, marketing, sales,
            and supply chain delivery across supermarkets, food service, and private label.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Task:</strong> Create a promotional video showcasing EFB&#39;s reach, capabilities, customers, markets,
            and vendor relationships. The objective was to support new partnership outreach beyond the UK &amp; Ireland,
            targeting customers across Europe and internationally.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Execution &amp; Result:</strong> From initial planning through delivery, I coordinated with the
            Brand Director to develop the script and storyboard, combining repurposed supplier footage with newly created
            assets. This included leveraging existing content relating to illy and Hershey&#39;s, including a shoot day
            directing Hershey&#39;s-branded black cabs across major London landmarks. The final video exceeded expectations
            as both a sales outreach tool and corporate explainer, and was used in sales presentations and prospect follow-ups.
