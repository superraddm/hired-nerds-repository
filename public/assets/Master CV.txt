Early Life/Hobby/Pre Career : I've been using computers from around 1990 starting with a commodore64, programming text adventure games with if/then statements and variables in BASIC. My Father was an IT consultant during the 1990's with companies like Compaq and Digital Equipment Corporation. He'd often bring home spare computing parts and machines, beginning with 386 and 486 systems. My family and I would set up local networks to play games like Doom and Duke Nukem over LAN. This started an interest in computers that hasn't stopped. Since the 486 days I've consistently upgraded the same systems, buying and installing new parts. Building PCs for friends and colleagues. Installing and operating Windows from version 3.1 to Windows 11.
