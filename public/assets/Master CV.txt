<<<<<<< HEAD
Early Life/Hobby/Pre-Career : 
IT: I've been using computers from around 1990 starting with a commodore64, programming text adventure games with if/then statements and variables in BASIC. My Father was an IT consultant during the 1990's with companies like Compaq and Digital Equipment Corporation. He'd often bring home spare computing parts and machines, beginning with 386 and 486 systems. My family and I would set up local networks to play games like Doom and Duke Nukem over LAN. This started an interest in computers that hasn't stopped. Since the x486 days I've consistently upgraded the same systems, buying and installing new parts. Building PCs for friends and colleagues. Installing and operating Windows from version 3.1 to Windows 11. I've built my own apps, plugins, databases.
Film and Video: Been playing with video cameras and making films [NOT MOVIES] from the age of 10 when I insisted my mum rent a video camera from the local video shop. We'd make simple films, stop motion animation out of clay and toys, and our own TV program. Where we'd introduce cartoons, and record them to tape using 2 VCRs and a SCART cable. Again, the interest has not stopped, and followed me well into my professional career. I know an incredible amount about plugging one thing into another, and how to get a signal without degradation from one spot to another. From cables, to online streaming protocols.
Circa 2002 first exposure to NLE Premiere Pro at college.
Started my first videograpy business age 18. Filming friends bands, then weddings, then some coprorate work. all on cheap mini DV cameras. Purchased my first 'prosumer' camera, the Sony PD-170. Filmed gigs and weddings with multiple cameras and separate mics and auido inputs. First exposure to multi-cam editing.
Acting and VO: I've been interested in acting from a very young age, and was good at it. As an adult I performed in amateur theatre and people wrote nice things. I've been fortunate enough to have some very limited paid acting and voiceover work.
