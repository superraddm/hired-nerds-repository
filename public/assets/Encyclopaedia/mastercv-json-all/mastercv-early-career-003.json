This period strengthened interpersonal communication and process reliability.\n\nBarclaycard (2005–2006): Worked in a financial service setting requiring accuracy, data handling, and compliance with regulated workflows.\n\nThese early positions provided a baseline for structured working, adherence to regulated processes, and clear communication—skills that later supported large-scale CRM, data, and automation projects.",
