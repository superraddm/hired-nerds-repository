  "text": "Jof Davies developed technical and creative skills from an early age. Childhood exposure to computers included the Commodore 64, followed by 386 and 486 Windows PCs. He experimented with BASIC programming, LAN gaming, troubleshooting hardware, and building early custom PCs. This early period established his grounding in troubleshooting, optimisation, and system-level thinking.\n\nBeginning around age ten, Jof used VHS camcorders and VCRs to film and edit his own short films, claymation sequences, and mock television shows. He taught himself linear editing, composition, framing, and timing without formal guidance. This period formed the foundation of his lifelong capability in video production.\n\nThroughout teenage years, Jof continued developing video skills by filming local events and experimenting with editing tools. He developed habits of self-directed learning, analytical thinking, and creative workflow building that later shaped his professional capabilities in video production, IT systems, and automation.",
