Jof Davies developed technical and creative skills from an early age. Childhood exposure to computers included the Commodore 64, followed by 386 and 486 Windows PCs. He experimented with BASIC programming, LAN gaming, troubleshooting hardware, and building early custom PCs. This early period established his grounding in troubleshooting, optimisation, and system-level thinking.

Beginning around age ten, Jof used VHS camcorders and VCRs to film and edit his own short films, claymation sequences, and mock television shows. He taught himself linear editing, composition, framing, and timing without formal guidance. This period formed the foundation of his lifelong capability in video production.

Throughout teenage years, Jof continued developing video skills by filming local events and experimenting with editing tools. He developed habits of self-directed learning, analytical thinking, and creative workflow building that later shaped his professional capabilities in video production, IT systems, and automation.

Formal education includes The Ferrers School (September 1996 – July 2001) attaining GCSEs: 2×A*, 3×B, 4×C. Further education includes The Tresham Institute, studying half of a BTEC National Diploma in Performing Arts (8 Units), and Northampton College, achieving A/S/2 Levels in Film Studies (B), Film & Video (C), and Acting BTEC Award (Merit).

Parallel to formal study, Jof continued expanding technical literacy in computing, AV equipment, editing workflows, and web technology. His early exposure to performing arts and media studies directly contributed to the long-term development of communication skills, scripting, direction, and editorial decision-making.

Section: ingestion-order
Text:
Recommended ingestion order for optimal semantic clustering in Vectorize:

1. Foundational sections: 001–003
2. Early career / previous roles: 004–007
3. MTDCNC overview and details: 008–018
4. Repositories and configuration files: 019–024
5. Workflow diagrams: 025–028
6. Technical and soft skills matrices: 029–030
7. Attributes, architecture, personal capabilities: 031–033
8. Video/AV/Production-specific chunks: 033–036
9. Tools, clients, achievements: 038–040
10. Hardware, compression, CRM engineering: 041–043
11. Final professional summary: 044
12. Index chunks: 045–046

This order ensures:
- Correct grouping of related content
- High retrieval accuracy
- Lower semantic noise during question answering

CHUNK047: ID: mastercv-index-047
Source: master-cv
Section: retrieval-metadata
Text:
Each chunk contains metadata fields including:

source: "master-cv"
section: <domain-name>
text: <the content>

Recommended sections:
- early-life, education
- employment-history
- mtdcnc
- workflows
- github
- html-json
- skills-technical
- skills-soft
- attributes
- systems-architecture
- production-video
- livestream
- crm-data

Your LLM should prefer:
- section-matching first
- semantic similarity second
- completeness over brevity

This improves deterministic behaviour when user queries span multiple domains.

CHUNK048: ID: mastercv-index-048
Source: master-cv
Section: retrieval-rules
Text:
Rules for generating answers using this dataset:

1. The LLM must answer only from retrieved context. No speculation is permitted.
2. If a query spans multiple domains, the LLM should retrieve multiple chunks (topK ≥ 8).
3. If relevant context is missing, the LLM must respond: “This is not documented in the reference files.”
4. Workflow examples must be described generically. The LLM must not state or imply that MTDCNC customer data, CRM records, or proprietary datasets were used. Employer may be referenced, but workflow data sources must remain abstract unless the USER explicitly asks for employer-specific detail.
5. No exaggeration or embellishment is permitted.
6. All answers must maintain a formal tone and align strictly with the role-specialisation output requirements.
7. The LLM may reference MTDCNC as the employer from 2016–Present in factual statements regarding responsibilities, systems, tasks, and achievements.
8. Process descriptions must emphasise method, architecture, and logic, not proprietary datasets.
9. In all outputs, factual consistency and safety take precedence over verbosity or interpretation.

CHUNK049: ID: mastercv-index-049
Source: master-cv
Section: ingestion-commands
Text:
To ingest any chunk into Cloudflare Vectorize via your Worker:

Use this single-line command in Windows CMD:

curl -X POST "https://app.joffad.workers.dev/api/ingest" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"id\":\"<CHUNK-ID>\",\"text\":\"<ESCAPED-TEXT>\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":\"master-cv\",\"section\":\"<SECTION>\"}}"

Notes:
- Escape all quotes inside text with \"
- Replace line breaks with \n
- For long chunks, place JSON into a file and use --data-binary "@file.json"

Example using file-based ingestion:

curl -X POST "https://app.joffad.workers.dev/api/ingest" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary "@mastercv-001.json"

CHUNK050: ID: mastercv-index-050
Source: master-cv
Section: validation
Text:
After ingestion, validate the dataset using the following test questions:

1. "Summarise Jof Davies’s video production experience."
2. "Describe the MTDCNC global ingest pipeline."
3. "What automation workflows has Jof created?"
4. "List Jof’s CRM engineering capabilities."
5. "What are Jof’s strongest soft skills?"
6. "Which industries has Jof served through MTDCNC?"
7. "What GitHub repositories has Jof built and what do they do?"
8. "Explain Jof’s knowledge of email development."

Expected behaviour:
- Answers should be specific, factual, and reference chunk content.
- No hallucination or invented detail.
- No missing-domain errors if ingestion is complete.
- Retrieval should consistently return the same content for similar queries.

CHUNK051: ID: mastercv-index-051
Source: master-cv
Section: llm-response-template
Text:
The LLM should use the following internal prompt structure:

SYSTEM:
You are an information agent that answers questions strictly using the provided context. You must not speculate. If the answer is not documented, state: "This is not documented in Jof's reference files."

USER:
<Question>

CONTEXT:
<Retrieved chunks joined by --- separators>

ASSISTANT:
<Answer derived solely from context>

CHUNK052: ID: mastercv-index-052
Source: master-cv
Section: frontend-api
Text:
Frontend queries to your Worker endpoint:

POST /api/chat
{
  "question": "<user question>"
}

Response:
{
  "answer": "<model output>"
}

Ensure:
- Debounce user input for rapid queries.
- Handle network timeouts and retry.
- Display "Based on available records..." to user for transparency.

CHUNK053: ID: mastercv-index-053
Source: master-cv
Section: maintenance
Text:
The Master CV Encyclopaedia should be updated whenever:

- A new project or automation is built.
- A new repository is published.
- A new workflow diagram is created.
- Major job responsibilities change.
- New certifications or skill advancements occur.

Each update should be added as:
- A new chunk, or
- A replacement of an existing chunk by re-ingesting the updated version.

Avoid modifying chunks inside Vectorize directly; always update by re-ingesting via the Worker.
