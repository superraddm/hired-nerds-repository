The Client: Eurofood Brands (EFB) us a UK-based importer and distributor established in 1991, specializing in bringing global food and beverage brands like Barilla, illy, Hershey's, and Peppadew to the UK & Ireland markets, focusing on brand building, marketing, sales, and supply chain for supermarkets, food service, and private label. They work with top brands to adapt products for the local market, managing distribution, quality, and ethical standards through in-house team. 

The Task: Create a promotional video showcasing Eurofood brands reach, skills, customers, markets and vendors. Aim of the video was to approach more customer's across Europe and the the world to partner with the client. 

The Execution: I worked with EFB from the intial planning stages through to video delivery. Co-ordinating with their brand director to script and storyboard the video. We discussed what we would shoot, what existing content could be re-purposed, and what new assets would be created to tell the story of EFB. EFB has a global network of suppliers, and there were plenty of existing assets to re-purpose for the video. I also had access to a wealth of footage that i had either shot or directed concerning their Illy coffee brand, and the world famous Hershey's chocolate brand; including a very interesting day spent directing Hershey's branded black cabs around London's most famous landmarks.

The Result: Exceeded client expectations both as a sales out reach tool, and corporate explainer video. Was used in sales presentations, and sent to prospective customers.
